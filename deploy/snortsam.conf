# IP Tables plug-in:
# You have to specify the adapter to block on (for example, eth0) and you can
# optionally add a logging option.

# Logging:
# Log level (0 = none/1 = sparse/2 = normal/3 = verbose):

# Roll-back configuration:
# The "rollbackthreshold" command accepts two numbers separated by a '/'.
# The first is the number of blocking requests and the second number
# represents the number of seconds.  So for example, if you set the first
# number to 10 and the second to 30, then the threshold will be crossed if
# your machine receives more than 10 blocked requests within 30 seconds.
rollbackthreshold 10/30

# This is the number of hosts (unique blocked IPs) to rollback if the above
# threshold is reached or surpassed.
rollbackhosts 20

# White list:
# Add a "dontblock" command for each hostname/IP (or network) address that
# should *never* be blocked.

# Don't block reserved private IP blocks:
dontblock 10.0.0.0/8
dontblock 172.16.0.0/12
dontblock 192.168.0.0/16
